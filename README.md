## About the project

### Difficulties encountered

- Finding all components states was long
- Too many different components states led to creation of base components that are a bit complex

### Success

- Usage of storyBook is clean to help development
- No error possible thanks to typescript

### Possible evolutions

- Make the app really responsive; actually phones screen sizes are not managed
- Better managment of buttons hover style
